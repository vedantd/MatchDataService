# MatchDataService
The sports results API repository is a web service that provides access to the results of various sports matches through web scraping. The API uses the Express.js framework to handle incoming requests and serve the requested data to the users.

This service is intended to be used by a bot that will push data from this service into a oracle smart contract deployed on EVM compatible chains.
